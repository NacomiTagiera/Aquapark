# Aquapark

This is a website of an imaginary aquapark with multiple animations and MUI components. It was my first fully responsive project created with HTML and CSS. As soon as I got familiar with the basics of React.js, I rewrote it. 

Technologies and libraries that I used:

- TypeScript,
- React.js,
- CSS,
- Material UI,
- Framer Motion,
- React Scroll,
- React Wavify.
